Trees in PostgreSQL, not only in: out too
=========================================

There is a tree stored in your postgres, the schema is::

  create table as mytree ( id int, parent int, int varchar ) ;

Let's put a few values::

  insert into mytree values ( null,  0,  '/'    );
  insert into mytree values ( 0,  1,     'home' );
  insert into mytree values ( 1,  2,     'jd'   );

  insert into mytree values ( 2,  3,     'foo'  );

  insert into mytree values ( 3,  4,     'bar'  );

In depth or in width first, when you receive a new arc, the first
element is the parent and the second element is the child and is an
unknown new node.

In depth first, the arc adds a new child, to the current node, an
ancestor of the current node. In width first, the arc adds a child, a
nephew or a sibling.
