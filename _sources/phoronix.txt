===================

For disk, memory and CPU performance, the Phoronix projects offers
sophisticated benchmarks while being simple to setup and use. Add the
*Phoronix* repository to the package repository list and install the
*phoronix-test-suite* package.

::

  sudo -s
  echo 'deb http://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/releases/repo pts.debian/' \
	 >> /etc/apt/sources.list
  aptitude update
  aptitude install phoronix-test-suite



Memorize the default option for batch runs. Enter *Yes* once for all
to save the results.

::

  phoronix-test-suite batch-setup
  # Answer 'Yes'


There dozens of test suites available categorized into types focused
for instance on the processor, on the disk, on the memory, etc. No
test suites on the network performance though.

The suite needs to be *installed*  once prior to execution. Note
that the installation process is very long as the test suite downloads
and compile specific software versions. It may be wise to do it during
the night.

::

  # Interesting test suites focusing on the processor
  phoronix-test-suite install compilation compression cryptography multicore

  # Test suite of type 'Disk' and memory
  phoronix-test-suite install disk filesystem system-disk memory


The test suite can be run with *run* command. Again, they take great
length to execute.

To install the test suite a second time on another machine, there is a
command to avoid having to download the files again:
*make-download-cache*. It is possible to use the file which were
installed in the first installation.
