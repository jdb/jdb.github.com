tp01: guess the number
======================

Copy and paste the following Python script in a text file and execute
: ``python guess.py`` to test it.

.. include:: guess.py
   :literal:



Internationalized version !

.. include:: guess2.py
   :literal:

Look at the commands at the top of the source. The
internationalization (i18n) tools will look for the translation file:

.. include:: en.po
   :literal:

This file was created by ::

  pygettext guess2.py
  sed s/CHARSET/UTF-8/ messages.pot > en.po
  $EDITOR en.po   # Here I filled in the blank with the english sentence
  mkdir -p language.d/en/LC_MESSAGES/
  msgfmt en.po -o language.d/en/LC_MESSAGES/guess.mo

Be erally careful with the filenames and location. The i18n tools
expect stuff to be where the source code say it should be. If the i18n
tools can't find the translation file, it fall back on the default
string with no error.
