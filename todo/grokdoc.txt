Editing articles
----------------

- Intro: you may want to include

  - an eye catcher, something in the news, or in the daily use,

  - the issue at hand, which is solved by the technology presented in
    the article,

  - the boundaries of the article to get a clearer scope of the
    article,

  - the prerequisite to this page: tutorial, package, buidout. 

    With the last three paragraph, the side effect, is that there is
    less need to think about an audience: readers will know whether
    they need it or not.

- Conclusion: you may want to have:
  
  - short recap of what was learnt

  - intro to advanced use
   
  - see also
   
  - cool articles
    
  - equivalent technologies

- When showing code, it is a bit raw to begin by the code, shouldn't we
  first present the intent of the code, then insert the code, and
  then, dwelve into interesting technical details?

- Maybe we should keep the jargon and acronyms low, it would help
  keeping the learning curve chewable (yes, I chew curves everyday).

  I propose to substitue whenever possible kgs, ztk, zope3, z3c and
  zope by *zope tool kit*. This page help but is not enough:
  http://docs.zope.org/zopetoolkit/about/concepts.html

  When talking about a specific package, make sure to use to nail the
  complete name several time before abbreviating it, for instance,
  zope.schema, zope.formlib


Accross the Grok site
---------------------

- Global TOC on the left is not really helpful, and a bit
  inconsistent. Shouldn't we just talk about **use cases**:
  installation, URL mappings, forms, search and persistence and make a
  separate sections about all the sexy **technologies**:: ajax, json,
  rdb, rest, xml-rpc.

- the favicon is not easily recognizable, too small, better use the caveman
  smashing tool icon (is it called a *club*?)

- The TOC of an article is not displayed at the top while the page is
  quite long (navigation is not easy), it would help grasping the
  general idea of the page to have the article TOC at the top

- For an article page, there is Title/author/part 1/paragraph : 3
  different fonts, 3 different colors, the author name is weirdly
  floating a bit, and there is no space between "author" and the
  author name (does the author string needs to appear, or can it be
  represented by the font and/layout?)

- On an article page, it is important to show the version and
  audience if left unspecified?

- The full zope urls are too long and should be hidden behind a nice
  link title (most browser display the target url in the status bar)
