Create an lvm partition merged from two fake partitions
-------------------------------------------------------

You can copy and paste these commands with no ill effects. They will
not operate on your real hard drive partitions.

#. create fake partition just for demonstration purpose with losetup::

     dd if=/dev/zero of=hda1 bs=1M count=20
     dd if=/dev/zero of=hda2 bs=1M count=10
     losetup /dev/loop1 hda1        # for demonstration purpose, I create two fake 
     losetup /dev/loop2 hda2        # partitions from newly created files with losetup.


#. creation and use of a logical volume spanning two partitions::

     # pvcreate /dev/loop1
       Physical volume "/dev/loop1" successfully created
     
     # pvcreate /dev/loop2
       Physical volume "/dev/loop2" successfully created
     
     # vgcreate data-disks /dev/loop2 /dev/loop1
       Volume group "data-disks" successfully created
     
     # lvcreate -n muzak -L 24M datadisks
       Logical volume "muzak" created
     
     # mkfs.ext3 /dev/mapper/datadisks-muzak
     
     # mkdir /mnt/muzak && mount /dev/mapper/datadisks-muzak /mnt/muzak
     
     # dd if=/dev/zero of=tons-of-muzak count=44000
     
     # du -sh tons-of-muzak
       22M     tons-of-muzak
     
     # cp tons-of-muzak /mnt/muzak

   From two partition (20M and 10M), we created a lv of 24M in which we
   copied more data (22M) than available on each of the partitions taken
   separatly.

#. cleaning up::

     # lvremove datadisks/muzak
     Do you really want to remove active logical volume "muzak"? [y/n]: y
       Logical volume "muzak" successfully removed
     
     # vgremove data-disks
       Volume group "data-disks" successfully removed
     
     # pvremove /dev/loop1 /dev/loop2
       Labels on physical volume "/dev/loop1" successfully wiped
       Labels on physical volume "/dev/loop2" successfully wiped
     
     ## lvm cleanup is done by now, let's clean the fake partitions
     # losetup -d /dev/loop2
     # losetup -d /dev/loop1
     # rm hda{1,2}


Resetting the filesystem after an lvm resize
--------------------------------------------

You may need the following so that lvs and df -h agrees on the disk sizes ::

  umount /dev/mapper/fnac-fnac
  e2fsck -f /dev/mapper/fnac-fnac
  resize2fs /dev/mapper/fnac-fnac
  
.. question 

Is the umount necessary ?

Mounting a logical volume from a livecd
---------------------------------------

You cannot boot a live CD and expect the logical volume to be "mount
ready" as is a standard ext3. You need to type ::

  vgscan --mknodes
  vgchange -ay

Now you're set ::

  lvscan
  mount /dev/mini/root /mnt/

Also, I could not ``vgscan``, with the feisty live even after having
installed ``lvm2`` (``Unable to mount drive ('LVM2_member')``, and
``No program “vgscan” found for your current version of LVM``). I had
to use the Knoppix liveCD v5, instead.
